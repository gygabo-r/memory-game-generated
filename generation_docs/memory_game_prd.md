# Memory Game - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

A simple, responsive memory card game built with Vite and CSS, featuring UTF-8 emoji icons. The game challenges players to match pairs of cards in a 4x4 grid through visual memory and pattern recognition.

## Technical Stack

- **Styling**: CSS (vanilla)
- **Icons**: UTF-8 Emoji characters
- **Testing**: Custom automated test implementation

## Game Specifications

### Grid Layout
- **Size**: 4x4 grid (16 tiles total)
- **Pairs**: 8 unique pairs of matching icons randomly selected from combined icon sets
- **Responsive**: Grid adapts to fill available screen space
- **Icons**: UTF-8 emoji characters sourced from multiple JSON files (animals, food, nature, objects, travel, fruits)

### Game Mechanics

#### Initialization
- Game starts automatically when page loads
- Icons are randomly shuffled and distributed across the grid
- All tiles start face-down (showing back design)

#### Gameplay Flow
1. Player clicks first tile â†’ tile flips with animation
2. Player clicks second tile â†’ tile flips with animation
3. **Match Logic**:
   - If tiles match: both remain face-up permanently
   - If tiles don't match: both flip back face-down after brief delay
4. Process repeats until all pairs are matched
5. Game completion triggers victory modal

#### Victory Condition
- VictoryModal component appears when all 8 pairs are successfully matched
- VictoryModal contains:
  - Large party popper emoji (ðŸŽ‰) as primary visual element
  - "You Won!" congratulatory text
  - "Start New Game" button to reset and play again

### User Interface Requirements

#### Visual Design
- Clean, modern interface
- Smooth flip animations for card interactions
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Attractive color scheme and typography
- Visual feedback for user interactions

#### Responsiveness
- Grid scales appropriately for different screen sizes
- Maintains aspect ratio and usability on mobile devices
- Touch-friendly tile sizes for mobile interaction
- Optimal spacing and layout across all viewport sizes

## Testing Requirements

### Automated Test Implementation
An automated test suite that simulates gameplay using a systematic solving strategy:

#### Test Strategy Algorithm
1. **First Tile Selection**: Always click the first unturned tile in grid order
2. **Second Tile Selection**: Click the next unturned tile that hasn't been paired with the first tile yet
3. **Memory System**: Track which tiles have been revealed and their positions
4. **Match Resolution**: Continue until match is found, then move to next unpaired tile
5. **Game Completion**: Detect when all pairs are matched
6. **Reset Cycle**: Automatically start new game and repeat testing

#### Test Validation Points
- Verify tile flip animations execute properly
- Confirm match detection logic works correctly
- Validate non-matching tiles flip back correctly
- Ensure victory modal appears at game completion
- Test new game functionality resets state properly
- Performance testing for animation smoothness

- [x] Randomly select 8 unique icons from combined icon pool for each game session
- [x] Use type imports for better TypeScript performance and clarity
- [x] Implement centered app layout with gradient background
- [x] Use HTML document title for game branding instead of in-page h1 element
- [x] Build VictoryModal component in separate directory with specific content
- [x] Include party popper icon, "You Won!" text, and new game button in VictoryModal
- [x] Style VictoryModal with proper modal overlay and content styling
- [x] Apply black text-shadow outline to emoji icons for better visibility against gradient backgrounds
- [x] Implement flexible grid system that scales with viewport
- [x] Test and optimize for mobile touch interactions
- [x] Ensure proper spacing and proportions across screen sizes
- [x] Optimize performance for smooth animations on all devices

### Phase 2: Game Configuration Interface
- [x] Create game size selector with 16, 24, and 36 tile options
- [x] Design size selector buttons with proportional visual differences
- [x] Implement theme selector for animals, foods, fruits, nature, and travel categories
- [x] Design theme selector buttons with distinct selected state styling
- [x] Display representative icons from each theme's JSON file on theme buttons
- [x] Set default selections: 16 tiles and animals theme
- [x] Implement localStorage persistence for user selections
- [x] Create game configuration page/screen before game starts with green "Start Game" button
- [x] Update VictoryModal to include two action buttons
- [x] Add "Play Again" button (primary style in green color) to restart with same settings
- [x] Add "Game Options" button (secondary style in beige color) to return to configuration screen

    - Click first hidden tile
    - Check next hidden tile - if match, move to next 'first' hidden tile and repeat
    - If no match, click first tile again to hide, then move to next hidden tile
