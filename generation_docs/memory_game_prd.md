# Memory Game - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

A simple, responsive memory card game built with Vite and CSS, featuring UTF-8 emoji icons. The game challenges players to match pairs of cards in a 4x4 grid through visual memory and pattern recognition.

## Technical Stack

- **Styling**: CSS (vanilla)
- **Icons**: UTF-8 Emoji characters
- **Testing**: Custom automated test implementation

## Game Specifications

### Grid Layout
- **Size**: 4x4 grid (16 tiles total)
- **Pairs**: 8 unique pairs of matching icons
- **Responsive**: Grid adapts to fill available screen space
- **Icons**: UTF-8 emoji characters for visual appeal

### Game Mechanics

#### Initialization
- Game starts automatically when page loads
- Icons are randomly shuffled and distributed across the grid
- All tiles start face-down (showing back design)

#### Gameplay Flow
1. Player clicks first tile â†’ tile flips with animation
2. Player clicks second tile â†’ tile flips with animation
3. **Match Logic**:
   - If tiles match: both remain face-up permanently
   - If tiles don't match: both flip back face-down after brief delay
4. Process repeats until all pairs are matched
5. Game completion triggers victory modal

#### Victory Condition
- Modal appears when all 8 pairs are successfully matched
- Modal contains:
  - Large party popper emoji (ðŸŽ‰) as primary visual element
  - "You Won!" congratulatory text
  - "Start New Game" button to reset and play again

### User Interface Requirements

#### Visual Design
- Clean, modern interface
- Smooth flip animations for card interactions
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Attractive color scheme and typography
- Visual feedback for user interactions

#### Responsiveness
- Grid scales appropriately for different screen sizes
- Maintains aspect ratio and usability on mobile devices
- Touch-friendly tile sizes for mobile interaction
- Optimal spacing and layout across all viewport sizes

## Testing Requirements

### Automated Test Implementation
An automated test suite that simulates gameplay using a systematic solving strategy:

#### Test Strategy Algorithm
1. **First Tile Selection**: Always click the first unturned tile in grid order
2. **Second Tile Selection**: Click the next unturned tile that hasn't been paired with the first tile yet
3. **Memory System**: Track which tiles have been revealed and their positions
4. **Match Resolution**: Continue until match is found, then move to next unpaired tile
5. **Game Completion**: Detect when all pairs are matched
6. **Reset Cycle**: Automatically start new game and repeat testing

#### Test Validation Points
- Verify tile flip animations execute properly
- Confirm match detection logic works correctly
- Validate non-matching tiles flip back correctly
- Ensure victory modal appears at game completion
- Test new game functionality resets state properly
- Performance testing for animation smoothness

## Development Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Setup
- [x] Initialize Vite project structure
- [x] Set up basic HTML structure
- [x] Create CSS reset and base styles
- [x] Implement responsive grid layout system

### Phase 2: Game Logic Implementation
- [ ] Create tile data structure and state management
- [ ] Implement random shuffle algorithm for icon distribution
- [ ] Build tile flip animation system
- [ ] Develop match detection and validation logic
- [ ] Create game state management (in-progress, completed)

### Phase 3: User Interface Development
- [ ] Design and implement tile visual states (face-down, face-up, matched)
- [ ] Create smooth CSS animations for tile flipping
- [ ] Implement click event handling and user interaction
- [ ] Build victory modal component with party popper icon
- [ ] Style modal with "You Won!" text and new game button

### Phase 4: Responsive Design Implementation
- [ ] Implement flexible grid system that scales with viewport
- [ ] Test and optimize for mobile touch interactions
- [ ] Ensure proper spacing and proportions across screen sizes
- [ ] Optimize performance for smooth animations on all devices

### Phase 5: Testing Suite Development
- [ ] Create automated test framework
- [ ] Implement systematic tile selection algorithm
- [ ] Build memory tracking system for revealed tiles
- [ ] Create game completion detection
- [ ] Implement automatic game reset and continuous testing
- [ ] Add test result logging and validation

### Phase 6: Progressive Web App Implementation
- [ ] Create web app manifest file
- [ ] Implement service worker for offline functionality
- [ ] Add installation prompt and app-like experience
- [ ] Enable offline gameplay capability
- [ ] Optimize for app-like performance and caching

### Phase 7: Polish and Optimization
- [ ] Performance optimization for animations
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [ ] Code cleanup and documentation
- [ ] Final responsive design testing
